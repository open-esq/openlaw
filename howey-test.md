**The Howey Test**

The U.S. Supreme Court case of *SEC v. Howey* established the test for whether an arrangement involves an investment contract.  An investment contract is a type of security.

In the context of blockchain tokens, the *Howey* test can be expressed as three independent elements (the third element encompasses both the third and fourth prongs of the traditional *Howey* test).  All three elements must be met in order for a token to be a security.

^ An *investment of money.*

{{Investment of money "Are tokens being sold in a crowdsale, at any time, regardless of whether sold for fiat or digital currency (or anything else of value) involving an investment of money?" => This element is probably satisfied. :: This element probably is *not* satisfied.}}

^ in a *common enterprise.*

{{Timing "Is the token sale happening before the protocol is functioning on a live network?" => This element is probably satisfied. :: {{sameReturn "Will all token holders receive the same return on their investment in proportion to their holdings?" => This element is probably satisfied. :: {{varyingReturn "Is there a possibility of varying returns between token holders, based on their participation?" => This element might not be satisfied. :: This element is probably satisfied.}}}}}}

^ with an *expectation of profits* predominantly from the *efforts of others.*

{{tokenFunction "Is action outside of the network required to make the token functional on the network?" => This element is probably satisfied. :: {{tokenFunction2 "Does the token have a function outside of the network?" => This element is probably satisfied. :: {{tokenMarketing "Is the token sale marketed as an initial coin offering?" => This element is probably satisfied. :: This element might not be satisfied.}}}}}}

The questions to the left will help to give a general estimate of whether these elements are met for a given project.
